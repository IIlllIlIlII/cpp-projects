### Luhn algorythm
	1.	Starting from the second-to-last digit, double every second digit moving left.
	2.	If a doubled digit is greater than 9, subtract 9 from it (or add its digits together).
	3.	Add all the results from step 1.
	4.	Then, add the sum of the digits that were not doubled (i.e., every other digit starting from the last one).
	5.	If the total sum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is valid.
